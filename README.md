# My personal Website

This is my personal project, originally created with the help of Girls Who Code and later refined to make it more aesthetically pleasing. It encompases facts and details about me as a person along with a portfolio detailing the work I have done related to programming or research! I initially set out to finish this project simply because it was a required task for the Girls Who Code Web Development course, but I soon found myself enjoying the creative freedom of making the website look and do whatever I wanted. I learned a great deal about HTML and CSS due to this project, which turned out to become an amazing learning opportunity.
## The Inception of this website

Through watching html and css courses, along with reading the documentation, I was able to make this website look more then just a barebone slate of images and text. The project I made in Girls who can code was a incredibly bare bones version of this website, since which I've tried to add more soul and personality to it. The most challenging aspect was, without a doubt, designing the homepageâ€™s background.
