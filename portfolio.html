      <h2>Projects & Research</h2>
      <ul class="content-list">
        <li><strong>AI & Rare Diseases for Teens in Health:</strong> I wrote a literature review on how AI is used to identify rare diseases. Learning into depth about SVMs, electronic health record (EHR) analysis, and unsupervised learning like K-means and hierarchical clustering specifically through the ApreciseKUre platform for Alkaptonuria, which is a rare inherited disease which can significantly lower the quality of life of a person. Learning about these were incredibly insightful and this experience strengthened my understanding of both the application and implementation of AI and Machine Learning in healthcare.</li>
        <li><strong>Paper Summaries:</strong> Read and reviewed 3 scientific papers on machine learning in medicine, focusing on real-world AI applications in diagnostics and patient stratification.</li>
      </ul>
